# Annea QA Automation Assignment

[![Playwright E2E Tests](https://github.com/MilJav11/qa-automation-annea/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MilJav11/qa-automation-annea/actions)

Professional E2E test suite automating the Seznam.cz email workflow using Playwright and Python.

## 🎯 What is Tested (Test Description)

This test suite covers the critical business path (Happy Path) of sending an email via the Seznam.cz web client:

1. Successfully log into a Seznam.cz email account (handling dynamic cookie/ad banners).
2. Navigate directly to the mailbox and initialize a new email to a predefined contact.
3. Dynamically generate and attach a local text document (`test_attachment.txt`).
4. Send the email and explicitly wait for the UI notification verifying successful delivery.
5. Safely log out of the account via the profile menu.

## 📊 Test Coverage Info

As an E2E UI automation suite, coverage is focused on **Functional Business Flows**:

- **UI Coverage:** Login Page, Mailbox Dashboard, Email Composer Modal, File Upload Dialog, Success Notification, Logout Flow.
- **Browser Coverage:** Configured for Chromium (Headless mode in CI/CD pipeline, headed mode for local development).
- **Resilience Coverage:** Handles strict-mode violations, dynamic element locators, and conditional UI states (e.g., cookie banners).

## 🚀 Features

- **BDD Framework:** Human-readable tests using Gherkin (`pytest-bdd`).
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Clean separation of test logic and UI locators.
- **CI/CD Integrated:** Automated test execution on every push via GitHub Actions.
- **Security:** Credential management using environment variables.
